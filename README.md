This project is Docker friendly from day one. To start working on it:

* Setup the diversity_in_tech container with `docker-compose build diversity_in_tech`
* Install dependencies with `docker-compose run diversity_in_tech mix deps.get`
* Create your database with `docker-compose run diversity_in_tech mix ecto.create`
* Migrate your database with `docker-compose run diversity_in_tech mix ecto.migrate`
* Install Node.js dependencies with `docker-compose run diversity_in_tech bash -c "cd assets; npm install"`
* Start the application with `docker-compose up`

## Setup testing environment with Docker

This step assumes you already followed instructions from previous paragraph.

* Create your testing database with `docker-compose run diversity_in_tech env MIX_ENV=test mix ecto.create`
* Migrate your testing database with `docker-compose run diversity_in_tech env MIX_ENV=test mix ecto.migrate`
* Run the test suite with `mix test`
* Run the test suite with coverage report on `cover` folder with: `docker-compose run diversity_in_tech env MIX_ENV=test mix coveralls.html`
